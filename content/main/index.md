<!--TODO: we need a "moto" for the landing page in the subtitle entry above. For the spinwheel it was "Children have the natural <em>curiosity</em> and <br> <em>capacity</em> to engineer a better world. <br> <br> Our kits just remind them.". MBA-type folks claim such stuff is super important.-->

The Qbead comes with a "[Field Guide](/book)" containing multiple educational and artistic activities written for students ages 12-212. In addition of the quantum science topics, the Qbead can also be programmed by anyone simply as a beautiful luminescent bluetooth-connected motion-sensing fashion accessory.
