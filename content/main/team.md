For the last few years, our team has run educational events that have enabled
thousands of attendees to experience the wonder of creating their own gadgets
through science and engineering.
We are proud to have channeled our passion for creating, teaching, and civil service
to empower the next generation of makers.
Through the Qbead, we hope to reach even more students.

<h1>Carlos</h1>
<h2>Delft University of Technology, QuTech</h2>
Carlos loves science, crafts, and art, and sometimes combines them into a beautiful gadget like the Qbead. On top of that, he enjoys mentoring and contributing to diversity in science and engineering. Examples are organizing science-art workshops with asylum seekers in Sweden and the quantum hackathon iQuHACK at MIT. 
Now at Delft University of Technology and QuTech, Carlos is a professor exploring quantum photonics while he continues to lead outreach projects to democratize science and technology.

<h1>Stefan</h1>
<h2>University of Massachusetts Amherst</h2>
Since high school Stefan has enjoyed sharing the wonders of science with
others, organizing extraculicular courses and summer break Physics events.
While a graduate student at Yale's Quantum Institute he felt most at home in
Yale's makerspace, preparing contraptions to be used in middle- and high-school
outreach events. He continued his reasearch work on photonic quantum
computers jointly at MIT and Harvard, but spends much of his free time
designing hands-on outreach materials, including the [SpinWheel](https://spinwearables.com/).
Now, as a professor at UMass Amherst, he is designing the Qbead as a way to bring the maker ethos to teaching Quantum Information Science.
